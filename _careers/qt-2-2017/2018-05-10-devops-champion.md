As technology consultants, we work with a variety of clients that hire us to solve complex and interesting problems. We believe in change through delivery and collaborate with client teams to build world-class technology that breaks through traditional enterprise models.
Each client we work with gives us a new perspective and a broad exposure to different technologies, which leads to a pretty unlimited learning environment. We are constantly questioning the status-quo, innovating, and delivering. If you have a passion for exploring new technologies, chances are you’ll fit right in.

We are looking for developers who share our enthusiasm for CD to:

* Build large-scale and distributed software systems
* Work almost exclusively with our customers to offer a combination of development and consulting services
* Coach our clients to practice CD & CI and reduce time from production to deployment and to adopt an agile development workflow
* Design and build end-to-end continuous delivery pipelines, including designing pipelines for infrastructure code and pipeline-integrated metrics and monitoring (observability) practices and infrastructure
* Deploy and manage virtualized and/or containerized workloads in development through production (Vagrant, Docker, VMWare, etc)
* Foster environments with stronger levels of trust, that give more autonomy to technologists

You’ll bring:

* Experience with infrastructure as code / provisioning tools like Chef, Puppet or Ansible
* Experience with one or more of the structured major PaaS platforms such as CloudFoundry or OpenShift and understand their benefits and lacks in deploying and end-to-end continuous delivery pipeline
* Familiarity with Cloud Native Architecture principles and specific tooling and approaches to support high-availability architectures
* Understanding of the pros and cons of the key Continuous Integration tools like Go, TeamCity, Jenkins and Concourse
* Knowledge in the administration of application and web servers and servlet containers such as WebSphere, Apache Tomcat, Jetty, Nginx, Mongrel, Passenger, Microsoft ISS, etc.
* Extensive experience in scripting languages ​​(golang, Shell, Ruby, Perl, Python, PowerShell, etc) and the SCM Tools like Git(Hub), SVN, Perforce and Mercurial
* Linux operating system management, operation and maintenance, and network-related knowledge
* Comfort with ambiguity and high level of flexibility
